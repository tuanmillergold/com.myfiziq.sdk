**3.2.** As between you and MyFiziq, MyFiziq owns all Intellectual Property Rights in the SDK and the Documentation.

### 4. Liability

**4.1.** Neither party is liable to the other party for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss or damage incurred by the other party, including liability for loss of profits, loss of business opportunity, loss of savings, or loss of data, even if the party has been advised of the possibility of such loss, damages, claims or costs.

**4.2.** To the maximum extent possible by law, we shall also have no liability for any direct loss or damage (i.e for any loss which falls under the first limb of *Hadley v Baxendale* (1854) 9 ex 341 being that which arises naturally, according to the usual course of things).

**4.3.** The SDK may come with implied non-excludable guarantees which are regulated by the Australian Consumer Law. The extent of the implied guarantees depend on whether you are a 'consumer' of goods or services within the meaning of that term pursuant to the Australian Consumer Law as amended. Where you are a 'consumer' for the purposes of the Australian Consumer Law, MyFiziq is required to provide and shall be deemed to have provided the following mandatory statement to You: "Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure."

**4.4.** If the SDK is supplied to you in your capacity as a 'consumer' within the meaning of that term in the Australian Consumer Law as amended you will have the benefit of certain non-excludable rights and remedies in respect of the SDK and nothing in this EULA excludes or restricts or modifies any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy which pursuant to the *Competition and Consumer Act* 2010 (Cth) is so conferred. However, if the SDK is subject to a non-excludable condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy implied by the Australian Consumer Law and the SDK is not ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption, then pursuant to s 64A of the Australian Consumer Law, MyFiziq limits its liability for its breach of any such non-excludable warranty, guarantee, right or remedy implied by the Australian Consumer Law (other than a guarantee implied by sections 51, 52 or 53 of the Australian Consumer Law) or expressly given by MyFiziq to you, in respect of the SDK, at MyFiziq's option, to one or more of the following:
   **(a)** if the breach relates to goods:
   **(a)(i)** the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
   **(a)(ii)** the repair of such goods;
   **(a)(iii)** the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or
   **(a)(iv)** the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; and
   **(b)** if the breach relates to services:
   **(b)(i)** the supplying of the services again; or
   **(b)(ii)** the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.

**4.5.** If MyFiziq elects to repair goods, the goods may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be used to repair goods. You acknowledge that where the goods are repaired and are capable of retaining user-generated data, it is possible that the repair of the goods may result in loss of data.

**4.6.** Any warranty against defects provided by MyFiziq to you as a 'consumer' under the Australian Consumer Law is in addition to other of your rights and remedies under a law in relation to the goods or services to which the warranty relates.

**4.7.** Except with respect to any non-excludable warranty, guarantee, right or remedy that may be implied by the Australian Consumer Law into this EULA, all conditions, warranties and guarantees implied in this EULA are excluded, to the extent possible by law.

### 5. Indemnity

**5.1.** You must indemnify, defend and hold MyFiziq and its affiliates, officers, directors, personnel, staff, suppliers, licensees, and other customers harmless from and against any and all liability, loss and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by such parties, in connection with or arising out of:
   **(a)** your use or misuse of the SDK;
   **(b)** your violation of this EULA; and/or
   **(c)** your breach of any applicable laws or regulations.

### 6. Confidentiality

**6.1.** Each party to this EULA agrees and acknowledges that it may receive confidential information of the other party during the Term of this EULA (**"Confidential Information"**).

**6.2.** You agree and acknowledge that the Documentation and the SDK constitutes and contains confidential and proprietary information of MyFiziq.

**6.3.** Each party (the "first party") agrees and acknowledges to take all prudent steps to ensure that the Confidential Information of the other party will be received and held by the first party in strict confidence and will not be disclosed by the first party, except:
   **(a)** with the prior written consent of the other party;
   **(b)** where disclosed to the employees or professional advisors of the first party on a confidential basis;
   **(c)** as required by the rules of any stock exchange; or
   **(d)** as required by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then, only to the extent required, and provided that the first party must promptly notify the other party of such requirement of disclosure and provide full particulars to the other party of the disclosure.

**6.4.** Confidential Information does not include any information:
   **(a)** that is independently developed, obtained or known by a party, without breaching any obligation of confidence to the other party; or
   **(b)** that is in the public domain, except where due to a breach of this EULA or any breach of any obligation of confidence.

**7.6.** Termination of this EULA does not affect any of your or MyFiziq's accrued rights.

**8.1.** If a dispute arises between you and MyFiziq out of or relating to this EULA ("Dispute"), any party to the Dispute must seek to resolve it strictly in accordance with the provisions of this clause. Compliance with the provisions of this clause is a condition precedent to seeking relief in any court in respect of the Dispute, except as otherwise provided in this clause.

**8.2.** A party seeking to resolve a Dispute must provide written notice of the existence and nature of the Dispute to the other party ("Notification"). Upon receipt of a Notification, each party must refer resolution of the Dispute to their chief executives (or nominees).
